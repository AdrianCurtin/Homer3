NOTE: This documentation is a work in progress. More formal and detailed documnetation will be added in the coming months. For now we include just quick startup notes:

To get Homer3 started in Matlab:

Open Matlab and in the command window, change the current folder to the Homer3 root folder that you downloaded. 

In Matlab command window, type

   >> setpaths

This will set all the required matlab search paths for Homer3. Note: this step should be done every time a new Matlab session is started. 

At this point you should be ready to start Homer3 from the Matlab command window.

To Be Continued ...
